# ResidentFrame
- This is another project in DosBox assembler where we've learnt to use 9 interrupt


## Main Idea
- Create a program which shows you a frame of **registers with their values**

## Results
- [x] Helpful frame which shows registers values while running Volkov Commander
- [x] Shows AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, CS, IP registers 


This task is to understand how to work with interruptions and simulate parallel processing.
